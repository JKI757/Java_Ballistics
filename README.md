# Java_Ballistics

This is essentially a Java re-imagining of Derek Yates' GNU Ballistics library from a very long time ago.  It was developed to use with Android back in the dark ages before the NDK was made available, and in fact powered the first ballistics calculator ever released for the Android platform.
